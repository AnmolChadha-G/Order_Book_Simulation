I have created a Order Book Simulation that has one server which manages clients as threads connected to server using TCP socket and clients can place order to buy and sell and server just picks the seller with lower
demand and buyer with higher bid and makes profit on it.The system uses threads for multiprocessing and socket for connection between server and clients.
